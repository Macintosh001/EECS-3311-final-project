Team
- Team meeting to plan out the UML for iteration 1.
- A simple design following the application/display/logic/persistence/objects pattern discussed in class was used.

Aaron
- Added some dependencies to the build.gradle file for javafx. Considering using javafx to handle the UI provided it has some advantage over java.swing

Monday, January 30th

Aaron
- Decided along with Behzad to go with java.swing to implement the UI functionality. Was able to render a simple Table that will display the inventory. At this point I decided to implement the UI in one big class in order to have an MVP ready for delivery, however I am researching what patterns I may use to better separate the UI code to promote maintainability and extensability for future iterations.

William
- Began work on the business logic class based on the current design.

Aaron
- Tweaked the Display class to utilize the stub

Sunday, February 5th

Aaron
- Added buttons (add and remove) to the Table and changed the Display class to interact with the ILogic interface rather than the concrete logic classes. Also added dialog box pop up when the buttons were clicked


Monday, February 6th

Aaron
- Add and remove buttons now are fully functional
