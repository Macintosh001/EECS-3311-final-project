### Windows
If you are using windows, and the instructions above do not work for running the app:
1. If opening the .jar file throws an error, try installing the newest version of java by following this link's instructions: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-windows Then try opening the .jar again, or restarting the command line, navigating to the directory of app.jar, and running `java -jar app.jar`.

If your .jar is still not working, these steps might help:
1.  Go to the following location in your file explorer: C:\ProgramFiles\Java then open the folder corresponding to your java version, for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19 and go to the bin folder C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin. Copy the adress of this folder.
2. Go to your windows settings. Click System > about > Advandced System Settings. 
3. In the pop up go to Environment Variables. 
4. In the second pop up, under system variables click on Path > Edit > New. 
5. Paste the address of the bin folder from earlier with a semi-colon. For example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin; would be pasted. Press ok.
6. Try to open the .jar file again. If working in the command line, you must restart the terminal before running `java -jar app.jar`again.
