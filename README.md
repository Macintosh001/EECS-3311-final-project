2. If none of the above works, go to the following location in your file explorer: C:\ProgramFiles\Java then open the folder corresponding to your java version, for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19 and go to the bin folder C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin. Copy the adress of this folder, and go to your windows settings. Click System > about > Advandced System Settings. In the pop up go to Environment Variables. In the second pop up, under system variables click on Path > Edit > New. Then paste the address of the bin folder from earlier with a semi-colon. For example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin; would be pasted. Press ok, and try to open the .jar file again.
